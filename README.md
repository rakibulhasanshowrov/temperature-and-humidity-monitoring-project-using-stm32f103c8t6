# temperature and humidity monitoring system using stm32f103c8t6 
# ArmV7 Architecture

# Requirements
1.stm32f103c8t6

2.debugger

3.LCD with I2C module

4.DHT11 Sensor

5.Buzzer

6.LED 

7.Stm32CubeIDE



Here I create a temperature and humidity monitoring system using stm32f103c8t6. 
the i2c  protocol for connecting led and humidity sensor (LCD & dht11) library code are gathered from internet 
and updated by me for this particular project.


# HAL library is used to define all function for processor. It has been Done automatically by CubeIDE while i configure the pin and other settings for the processor.
